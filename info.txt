from app import BlogPost imports the BlogPost db created.
BlogPost.query.all() is used to split all of the blogpost in a list. So this will print the list of all the content in the blogpost db. 
BlogPost.query.all()[0] is used to print the index 0 blogpost made.
BlogPost.query.all()[0].title is used to print the title of the 0th index blogpost created.
BlogPost.query.filter_by(title='First Blog Post!').all() is used to get the all blogpost by the given title. 
BlogPost.query.get(1) is used to get element by id.
db.session.delete(BlogPost.query.get(2)) This is used to delete from the db. unique id is also required to be given in get(). (in this BlogPost is the name of the db model)
db.session.commit() must be done after the above syntax inorder to delete something. 

BlogPost.query.get(2).author = 'ABCD' , this way we can change the author of the post. 
db.session.commit() needs to be done after that inorder to show the changes on the website.
